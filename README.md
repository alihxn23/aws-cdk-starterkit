## Features

- ⚡ Rapid Setup: Jumpstart your project within minutes by tweaking a [single configuration file](./.projenrc.ts). Spend less time on boilerplate and more on building.
- 🤹‍♂️ Multi-Account Flexibility: Ready for enterprises, this starter kit supports multi-account setups right from the start, enabling scalable and segregated cloud environments.
- 🤖 Automated Deploy Pipelines: Embrace CI/CD with out-of-the-box GitHub Actions workflows, automating your deployment processes for efficiency and reliability.
- 🏗️ Project structure: The [project is structured](#project-structure) in a clean and intuitive way that allows you to easily manage your constructs and stacks for this CDK App.
- 🛡️ Seamless Security: Leverage OpenID Connect for secure AWS deployments. Authenticate your GitHub Actions workflows directly with AWS, eliminating the need for stored credentials or long-lived secrets.
- 🧹 Preconfigured TypeScript Excellence: Hit the ground running with pre-set compiler options in [tsconfig.json](./tsconfig.json), ensuring your code is clean, efficient, and error-free from the start.
- 📏 Best Practice Linting: Adopt coding best practices effortlessly with a pre-configured ESLint setup [.eslintrc.json](./.eslintrc.json), maintaining high code quality and consistency.
- 🚀 Enhanced Pull Requests: Benefit from a built-in, fancy pull request template, making code reviews more structured and informative.

## Setup Guide

This project requires a atleast **Node.js version 20**.

All the config that is needed to personalise the CDK App to your environment is defined in the [.projenrc.ts file](./.projenrc.ts).

**To get started, follow these steps:**

1. Fork / clone this repo

2. Add a Personal Access Token to the repository settings on GitHub, follow these [instructions for setting up a fine-grained personal access token](https://projen.io/docs/integrations/github/#fine-grained-personal-access-token-beta).

3. Install the projects dependencies using: `npm ci`

4. Customize the AWS Region and Account IDs in the [.projenrc.ts](./.projenrc.ts) file to match your AWS setup:

```ts
// Define the AWS Region for the CDK app
project.tasks.addEnvironment('CDK_DEFAULT_REGION', 'us-east-1');

// Define the target AWS accounts for the different environments
type Environment = 'dev' | 'test' | 'staging' | 'production';
const targetAccounts: Record<Environment, string | undefined> = {
  dev: '987654321012',
  test: '123456789012',
  staging: undefined,
  production: undefined,
};
```

5. Run `npx projen` to generate the github actions workflow files.

6. AWS CLI Authentication: Ensure you're logged into an AWS Account (one of the ones you configured in step 4) via the AWS CLI. If you haven't set up the AWS CLI, [then follow this guide](https://towardsthecloud.com/set-up-aws-cli-aws-sso))

7. Deploy the CDK toolkit stack to your AWS environment with `cdk bootstrap` if it's not already set up.

8. Deploy the GitHub OIDC Stack to enable GitHub Actions workflow permissions for AWS deployments. For instance, if you set up a `dev` environment, execute `npm run dev:deploy`.

9. Commit and push your changes to the `main` branch to trigger the CDK deploy pipeline in GitHub.

Congratulations 🎉! You've successfully set up your project.

## Project Structure

When working on smaller projects using infrastructure as code, where you deploy single applications that don’t demand extensive maintenance or collaboration from multiple teams, it’s recommended to structure your AWS CDK project in a way that enables you to deploy both the application and infrastructure using a single stack.

However, as projects evolve to encompass multiple microservices and a variety of stateful resources (e.g., databases), the complexity inherently increases.

In such cases, adopting a more sophisticated AWS CDK project organization becomes critical. This ensures not only the ease of extensibility but also the smooth deployment of each component, thereby supporting a more robust development lifecycle and facilitating greater operational efficiency.

To cater to these advanced needs, your AWS CDK project should adopt a modular structure. This is where the **AWS CDK starterkit** shines ✨.

Here’s a closer look at how this structure enhances maintainability and scalability:

```bash
.
├── cdk.context.json
├── cdk.json
├── LICENSE
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
├── README.md
├── src
│  ├── assets

│  │  │  └── hello-world
│  │  │     └── Dockerfile

│  │        └── lambda_function.py
│  ├── bin
│  │  ├── cicd-helper.ts
│  │  ├── env-helper.ts
│  │  └── git-helper.ts
│  ├── constructs
│  │  ├── base-construct.ts

│  ├── main.ts
│  └── stacks
│     ├── base-stack.ts
│     ├── github-oidc-stack.ts
│     └── index.ts
├── test
│  ├── __snapshots__
│  │  └── main.test.ts.snap
│  └── main.test.ts
├── tsconfig.dev.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

As you can see in the above tree diagram, the way this project is setup it tries to segment it into logical units, such as **constructs** for reusable infrastructure patterns, **stacks** for deploying groups of resources and **assets** for managing source code of containers and lambda functions.

Here is a brief explanation of what each section does:

- `src/assets`: Organizes the assets for your Lambda functions and ECS services, ensuring that the application code is neatly encapsulated with the infrastructure code.
- `src/bin`: Contains utility scripts (e.g., `cicd-helper.ts`, `env-helper.ts`, `git-helper.ts`) that streamline environment setup and integration with CI/CD pipelines.
- `src/constructs`: Houses the core building blocks of your infrastructure. These constructs can be composed into higher-level abstractions, promoting reusability across different parts of your infrastructure. Check out the [README in the constructs folder](./src/constructs/README.md) to read how you can utilize environment-aware configurations.
- `src/stacks`: Dedicated to defining stacks that represent collections of AWS resources (constructs). This allows for logical grouping of related resources, making it simpler to manage deployments and resource dependencies. Check out the [README in the stacks folder](./src/stacks/README.md) to read how you can instantiate new stacks.
- `src/lib/main.ts`: This is where the CDK app is instantiated.
- `test`: Is the location to store your unit or integration tests (powered by jest)
